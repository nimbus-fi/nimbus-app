# ðŸš€ Nimbus Fi ðŸš€

## Project Overview

Nimbus Fi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables users to form community-based credit unions for lending and borrowing at preferential rates. The platform leverages smart contracts for governance and operations, providing a secure and transparent financial ecosystem.

## Smart Contracts

4. **Preferential Rates**: Community members enjoy better interest rates compared to traditional finance

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-chain support for increased accessibility
- Integration with decentralized exchanges for seamless asset swapping
- Yield farming opportunities within the community pools
- Advanced risk management tools for borrowers and lenders


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
